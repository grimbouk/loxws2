# Copilot instructions for loxws2

- **Repo purpose:** This repository stores user and API documentation for a Loxone/Miniserver integration (PDFs) and a `LoxAPP3.json` app configuration under `private/`. There is no source code in this repo; treat it as a documentation/configuration bundle.

- **Top-level layout:**
  - `documentation/` : Primary canonical artifacts are PDFs (e.g. `CommunicatingWithMiniserver.pdf`, `StructureFile.pdf`). These are binary outputs — do not attempt to modify them directly unless provided with the original source files elsewhere.
  - `private/LoxAPP3.json` : Loxone application JSON. This is the only editable structured file in the repo — changes may represent device/logic configuration.

- **Big picture / when to edit:**
  - If asked to update behavior, first confirm whether a source (markdown/LaTeX/Word) exists outside this repo; editing PDFs directly is not intended.
  - For configuration changes, modify `private/LoxAPP3.json` only when you know the Loxone app schema and the downstream process that imports it; preserve formatting and comments where present.

- **Workflows & commands:**
  - There are no build or test scripts in this repo. Typical actions are: edit `private/LoxAPP3.json`, update docs (if you have source), and bump version/notes in commit messages.
  - Before changing `LoxAPP3.json`, ask the user how they validate changes (e.g., local Loxone Miniserver import, a separate CI tool, or manual upload).

- **Conventions & patterns to follow in this repo:**
  - Small, focused commits with a clear subject referencing which PDF or `LoxAPP3.json` section changed.
  - When creating new documentation, prefer adding source files (Markdown) alongside a short README describing how to regenerate PDFs; do not replace PDFs with editable formats without user consent.

- **Integration points & risks:**
  - `private/LoxAPP3.json` likely integrates with a Loxone Miniserver. Changing it can alter device behavior; require user confirmation for impactful edits.
  - PDFs are authoritative documents; do not delete them or assume they are autogenerated unless the repo contains source files (none found here).

 - **Sensitive data handling:**
   - The `private/` folder contains sensitive configuration (for example `private/LoxAPP3.json`) and must never be uploaded to remote Git hosts or included in commits.
   - This repository already includes a `.gitignore` entry for `private/`; if you find `private/` files tracked in git, stop and ask the user before attempting history rewrites.
   - When asked to modify `private/LoxAPP3.json`, operate only on a local copy and do not push any changes. Confirm the user's validation/deployment workflow before making edits.

- **Examples / references in this repo:**
  - `documentation/CommunicatingWithMiniserver.pdf` — explains API/communication patterns to reference when changing `LoxAPP3.json` or advising on integrations.
  - `documentation/StructureFile.pdf` — useful when asked about the structure or expected fields inside `LoxAPP3.json`.

- **When uncertain, ask these questions (short):**
  1. Do you have the source files used to create the PDFs? (Yes/No)
  2. How are `LoxAPP3.json` changes validated or deployed? (local import / CI / manual)
  3. Should edits be applied directly in this repo or prepared as a patch for the user's Loxone toolchain?

- **Do not assume:**
  - That this repo contains build/test tooling.
  - That PDFs are safe to edit in-place.

If you want me to expand this with regeneration steps (if source exists) or a short README for `private/LoxAPP3.json` editing guidance, tell me which workflow you use to validate changes.

**Note:** Treat any `private/` content as confidential. If you want, I can add a short `private/README.md` (kept locally) describing local-only handling steps.
